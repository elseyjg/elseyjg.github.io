I am a sixth-year PhD canidate in the [Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences](https://pbs.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University. I work in the lab of [Veit Stuphorn](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/research/labs/veit-stuphorn-laboratory), studying the neurophysiological mechanisms of response inhibition and self-control.

Prior to graduate school, I worked as a post-baccalaureate research assistant under the supervision of [Jeffrey Schall](https://www.yorku.ca/science/research/schalljd/) at Vanderbilt University. While there, I developed my interest in [bridging brain to behavior](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.141907). I received my undergraduate degree in Experimental Psychology from the University of South Carolina, where I worked in [Dawn Wilson](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/psychology/our_people/directory/wilson-king_dawn.php)'s health intervention lab.
