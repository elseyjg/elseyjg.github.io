I am a sixth-year PhD canidate in the [Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences](https://pbs.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University. I work in the lab of [Veit Stuphorn](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/research/labs/veit-stuphorn-laboratory), studying the neurophysiological mechanisms of response inhibition and self-control.
